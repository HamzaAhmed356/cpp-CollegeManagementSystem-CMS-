# College Management System using C++ (OOP)

## Project Overview
The **College Management System** is a console-based application developed in **C++**.  
It is designed to manage basic college operations such as **student admissions**, **teacher job applications**, **admin login**, and **record viewing** using **file handling**.

This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, **file handling**, and **Windows console features**.

---

## Objectives
- Store and manage **student records**
- Store and manage **teacher job applications**
- Provide **secure admin login**
- Allow students and teachers to access their portals
- Use files to permanently store data

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Inheritance
  - Encapsulation
  - Static members
  - Templates
- File Handling (`fstream`, `ifstream`, `ofstream`)
- Exception Handling (`try-catch`)
- Windows Console Features
  - Color handling (`windows.h`)
  - Keyboard input (`conio.h`)
- Menu-driven program design

---

## System Modules

### Admin Module
- Secure login using **name and password**
- View:
  - Student records
  - Teacher records
  - Student admission applications
  - Teacher job applications

### Student Module
- Student Admission Form
- Student Portal (login using **ID & CNIC**)
- Data stored in text files

### Teacher Module
- Teacher Job Application
- Teacher Portal (login using **ID & CNIC**)
- Data stored in text files

### Information Section
- Displays project name
- Project members
- Project purpose

## Default Admin Credentials
Admin Name : Hamza Ahmed
Admin Password : password


---

## Files Used
| File Name | Purpose |
|----------|--------|
| `AdmissionStudentFile.txt` | Stores student admission data |
| `StudentFile.txt` | Stores student records |
| `TeacherFile.txt` | Stores teacher records |
| `JobTeacherFile.txt` | Stores teacher job applications |

---

## How to Run the Project
1. Open **Visual Studio** or any C++ compiler
2. Create a **Console Application**
3. Copy and paste the source code
4. Compile and run the program
5. Make sure you are using **Windows OS** (required for `windows.h`)

---

## Requirements
- Windows Operating System
- C++ Compiler (Visual Studio recommended)
- Basic knowledge of C++

---

## Future Improvements
- Replace text files with a **database**
- Encrypt admin passwords
- Improve UI using **graphics**
- Remove `goto` statements
- Add input validation
- Cross-platform compatibility
