# College Management System (C++)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **College Management System** is a console-based application developed in **C++**.  
It is designed to manage basic college operations such as **student admissions**, **teacher job applications**, **admin login**, and **record viewing** using **file handling**.

This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, **file handling**, and **Windows console features**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Store and manage **student records**
- Store and manage **teacher job applications**
- Provide **secure admin login**
- Allow students and teachers to access their portals
- Use files to permanently store data

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Inheritance
  - Encapsulation
  - Static members
  - Templates
- File Handling (`fstream`, `ifstream`, `ofstream`)
- Exception Handling (`try-catch`)
- Windows Console Features
  - Color handling (`windows.h`)
  - Keyboard input (`conio.h`)
- Menu-driven program design
